# OpenCv-Perspective-Transformation
Key point is determining closest points to origin by effective way :
1)first i calculted all euclidean distances (BUT euclidean not important i could be any distances as well )
2)i stored them all in len -> array and made copy of that array as len_2
3)after all i sorted len array and it compared all distances if distance equals then it adds that point into new vector
And that is all that one (new vector) is our sorted point set!
